Categories
##########

Categories are a way to organize Mautic elements. Categories are available for Assets, Campaigns, Emails, Focus Items, Forms, Pages, Points, Social Monitoring and Stages. There are two ways to use Categories:

1. Create element-specific Categories (e.g. only for Assets, Emails or Forms)
2. Create global Categories for all Mautic elements

Creating and managing Categories
********************************

To create new Categories, go to the Settings menu in the top right corner of Mautic. There choose Categories.

When creating a new Category you can select type, title, description, alias, color and published status. The color is helpful to quickly find Mautic elements by their appropriate Category when viewing things like the Calendar or other areas within Mautic.

Using Categories for Contacts
*****************************

In addition to organizing various Mautic elements Categories can be used to organize Contacts. In Contact details use the Preference menu to open Contact Preference Center.
